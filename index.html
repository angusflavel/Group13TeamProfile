										<p>My main interests related to IT are to do with Space, Agriculture, Weather and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
										<p>Terminator II: Judgement Day is a documentary, not a movie. – After this my interest in IT was eternally sparked.</p>
										<p>In all seriousness a friend of mine in school was incredible with computers, this always garnered my interest subconsciously. Eventually I started a small finance start-up with this friend and other business partners. 3 years later I’m choosing to come to RMIT to solidify my programming knowledge, and hopefully learn how to develop my own ideas, outsourcing development less.</p>
										<p>I expect to have a basic level understanding of how open-source projects are created and collaborated on through services like Github, and create my own projects that can be collaborated on with others.</p>

										<p>Always had in interest in how things worked both mechanical and electrical. First computer was a commodore 64 then apple 2c, then IBM compatible xt, then Amiga 500. </p>
										<p>Taught myself Assembly language 8086,68000 and 6502 and electronics repair. Experience Professionally in IT is brief, in the early 1990-2000 part-time employment with a couple of companies mainly in pc repairs/builds and sales.</p>
										<p>Was involved in Ipswich city council website green pages around year 1995 when things were slow, and simplicity was crucial. I have mostly been employed in factory shift work for 18 years for many reasons. </p>
										<p>I have had enough and found online study at RMIT through O.L.A. in the field of I.T. I’m hoping to get my IT knowledge up to date, whether it be Networking/Hardware, Coding or Administration. I don’t even know what types of jobs types are out there in The I.T.  field. I like fixing hardware and coding for myself and helping other people solve problems.</p>
